        <!-- Furthering my commitment to tech excellence and diversity, I joined DevMountain, a program that has allowed me to deepen my technical expertise and broaden my perspective on how technology can be a tool for social mobility and community transformation. My journey through DevMountain has been an extension of my advocacy for diversity in tech, providing me with new avenues to support and mentor women stepping into this field. -->

        <!-- As a Latina in tech, my journey is both personal and collective. With each line of code, I'm not only building solutions but also bridges—bridges toward a more inclusive and diverse tech landscape. My passion for technology and diversity fuels my daily work, driving me to support initiatives like CFG and to embrace every opportunity to mentor and uplift others. In doing so, I hope to inspire the next generation of women in tech to pursue their passions fearlessly, knowing they have a community behind them every step of the way.</p> -->
